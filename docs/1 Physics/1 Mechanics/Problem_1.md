# Problem 1

# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## Introduction

Projectile motion is a fundamental topic in mechanics that describes the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance. The horizontal distance traveled by the projectile, known as the **range**, is a function of the launch angle and initial velocity.

## Theoretical Background

The motion of a projectile can be analyzed by decomposing it into horizontal and vertical components. The equations of motion are:

### Equations of Motion

- **Horizontal motion:**
  $x = v_0 \cos(\theta) t$
  Since there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction (ignoring air resistance), the horizontal velocity remains constant.

- **Vertical motion:**
  $y = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$
  where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

To find the total time of flight, we set $y = 0$ (assuming the projectile lands at the same height from which it was launched):

$t_{total} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}$

Substituting this into the horizontal motion equation gives the range formula:

$R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}$

## Constants

- Gravitational acceleration on Earth: $g_{earth} = 9.81$ m/sÂ²
- Gravitational acceleration on the Moon: $g_{moon} = 1.62$ m/sÂ²
- Initial velocities considered: $10, 20, 30$ m/s

## Range Calculation and Visualization

We analyze the range for different launch angles (0Â° to 90Â°) and compare it for Earth and Moon conditions.

## Observations

- The range is maximized at $\theta = 45^\circ$.
- Increasing $v_0$ increases the overall range.
- The range is significantly greater on the Moon due to lower gravity.

## Numerical Example

For an initial velocity of $v_0 = 20$ m/s and a launch angle of $\theta = 45^\circ$ :

- **On Earth:**
  $R = \frac{20^2 \sin(90^\circ)}{9.81} \approx 40.8 \text{ m}$
- **On the Moon:**
  $R = \frac{20^2 \sin(90^\circ)}{1.62} \approx 247.8 \text{ m}$

## Practical Applications

- **Ballistics**: Understanding projectile motion is crucial for artillery and missile trajectories.
- **Sports**: Optimizing the launch angle in sports like basketball, soccer, and golf.
- **Space Exploration**: Calculating trajectories for lunar landings and rover deployments.
